# Empirical Evaluation of Predicting Solar Energy for Power Grid Integration
Since the discovery of the photovoltaic effect by Edmund Becquerel in 1839, solar energy has evolved into a crucial component of global sustainable energy solutions. Integrating solar power into energy grids is essential today, yet it is challenging due to its intermittent nature and complex prediction requirements. This study investigates the optimisation of solar energy prediction, employing advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques established on meteorological data to enhance grid integration. The study aims to systematically evaluate and enhance the accuracy of predictive algorithms, thereby improving the stability and efficiency of power grids through more effective solar energy utilisation.
Applying ML and DL techniques, the research systematically evaluates and compares the efficacy of various algorithms in predicting solar power generation. The study leverages a comprehensive dataset to examine the effectiveness of models like Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, KNN, Gradient Boosting, LSTM, and hybrid approaches, fine-tuned through meticulous hyperparameter optimisation.
The methodology embraces a quantitative and experimental approach, applying thorough statistical analyses to assess model performance based on Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, R-squared, and Root Mean Squared Error.
The results underscore the superior predictive accuracy of hybrid models, particularly LSTM-MLR, which demonstrates a notable enhancement in precision over conventional ML techniques. The findings provide significant implications for grid management, offering a foundation for the broader adoption of solar energy through improved prediction, which is crucial for the stabilisation and efficiency of power grids.
This work is significant in the energy sector's environmental, economic, and technical domains. It contributes to the transition towards renewable energy sources and reduces dependency on non-renewable resources. The study encapsulates the potential of integrating cutting-edge techniques in solar energy forecasting, promoting sustainability, and driving the energy industry towards a more resilient future.

# Empirical Evaluation of Predicting Solar Energy for Power Grid Integration
Solar energy has become crucial to global sustainable energy solutions. However, integrating solar power into energy grids presents challenges due to its intermittent nature. This study investigates the optimisation of solar energy prediction using advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models based on meteorological data to enhance grid integration and evaluate and improve predictive algorithm accuracy for enhanced power grid stability and efficiency. Employing ML and DL techniques, the project evaluates various algorithms' efficacy in predicting solar power generation. Comprehensive dataset analysis and statistical evaluations were conducted to assess model performance, and the results highlight the superior predictive accuracy of hybrid models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory and Multiple Linear Regression, which surpasses conventional ML and DL techniques. These findings significantly impact grid management, facilitating broader solar energy adoption through improved forecasting. This project contributes to the transition towards renewable energy sources, reducing reliance on non-renewable resources and promoting sustainability in the energy sector.
